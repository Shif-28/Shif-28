### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Shif and based in London. I am an aspiring developer with a passion for coding and problem solving. 

I have recently completed the HyperionDev Software Engineering Bootcamp (with a 100% pass rate!) and will be using my Github to show my personal projects as I continue to learn and develop my coding skills.

I am also currently a full-time Climate Change Resilience Consultant and will be looking to utilise my coding skills to support my project work.

## :desktop_computer: Tech Stack
 I am currently using:
- Python
- SQL
- Django

:books: I have plans to learn additional languages and frameworks through personal projects so watch this space! 

## ðŸ”­ Current Projects

I'm currently working on:
- [X] Push my bootcamp projects to Github
- [ ] Adding a GUI to my current projects
- [ ] Taking on a more advanced project that utilises a combination of Python and SQL (maybe others!)
- [ ] Learn another language such as C++
